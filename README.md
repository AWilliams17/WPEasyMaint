# WPEasyMaint - It's a Maintenance Mode plugin.
This is an old plugin I wrote when I first started learning WordPress.  
It's generally useless compared to most 'maintenance mode' plugins  
out there, but I'll put it up here just for looking back on.  
And hey, I'll probably even work on it some and add features.  
  
# Usage  
After putting the .php file into your plugins directory, navigate  
to the admin panel and locate the Easy Maintenance Mode section,  
then check the checkbox to turn on maintenance mode. This will  
restrict all site visitors but the administrator from viewing anything  
other than a "Site under maintenance" page.
